## Introduction

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and tools to work with them efficiently.

## Installation

To install NumPy, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Basics

NumPy arrays are the foundation of most numerical computing in Python. They are similar to Python lists but more efficient for numerical operations.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

## Arrays

NumPy arrays come in two flavors: vectors (1-dimensional) and matrices (2-dimensional or more). They can be created using various methods.

```python
# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

## Operations

NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that operate on arrays, making it easy to perform element-wise operations.

```python
# Element-wise addition
result = arr_1d + 10
```

## Indexing and Slicing

Accessing elements of a NumPy array is similar to Python lists. Indexing starts at 0, and negative indices count from the end.

```python
# Accessing elements
element = arr_1d[2]

# Slicing
subset = arr_1d[1:4]
```

## Broadcasting

NumPy arrays enable broadcasting, allowing operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes.

```python
# Broadcasting
arr_broadcasted = arr_2d + np.array([10, 20, 30])
```
